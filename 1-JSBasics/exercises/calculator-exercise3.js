// Make a Calculator! using prompt(), and variables, make a program that does the following:
// 1. Prompts the user for first number.
// 2. Stores that first number
var firstNumber = prompt("Enter first number!");
// 3. Prompts the user for the second number.
var secondNumber = prompt("Enter second number!");
// 4. stores that number and responds with the SUM by using an alert.  
var sum = Number(firstNumber) + Number(secondNumber);
alert("The sum of the two numbers is" + sum);
// BONUS: Make a program that can subtract, multiply, and also divide!
